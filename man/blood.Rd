\title{Network of blood types (directed)}
\format{
A list of two data frames:
\itemize{
\item the edges data set consists of three variables of length 27:
\itemize{
  \item from, to: factor variables of blood types describing the relationship 'is compatible with'
  \item group\_to: factor variable with levels 'same' and 'diff' for same or different blood type group not regarding the rho-gam factor.
}
\item the vertices data set consists of five variables and 32 rows:
\itemize{
  \item label: factor variable of blood types,
  \item type: factor variable of blood type, not regarding the rhesus factor,
  \item rho: factor variable: 'pos' and 'neg' describing the rhesus factor,
  \item Ethnicity: factor variable of four variables: 'Caucasians', 'African.American', 'Hispanic', and 'Asian',
  \item Predominance: numeric variable consisting of the percentage points of each blood type within each ethnicity.
