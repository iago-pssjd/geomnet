#' Number of JTTs in a graph
#'
#' Number of jumping transitive triplets (JTT) in a graph. A JTT between three nodes i,j,
#' and k is defined as the situation that when there is a (directed) edge from i to j and an
#' edge from j to k there is also a direct edge from i to k.
#' In an undirected situation we can think of any undirected edge as two directed edges between the two nodes involved.
